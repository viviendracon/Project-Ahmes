## Sovereign Semiconductor Fabrication through Advanced Scanning-Probe Lithography

---

**By Vivien Dracon, GPT o3, Claude Sonnet 3.7, Gemini 2.5 Pro**  
**April 27, 2025**

## 1 Executive Summary

Global reliance on a single-vendor extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) ecosystem exposes the semiconductor supply chain to geopolitical shock and prohibitive capital costs. **Project Ahmes** proposes a five-year, USD 35 million program that advances four complementary, **mask-less lithography** tracks—anchored by a massively-parallel *Millipede* thermal scanning-probe lithography (SPL) platform enhanced with University of Virginia's 2024 **phonon-polariton heat routing** breakthrough.

The outcome is a distributed, modular fabrication capability for 45nm-class logic and specialty ASICs at strategic scale. This node size is deliberately chosen to address immediate needs in defense electronics, radiation-hardened space components, automotive safety systems, and mixed-signal applications, while establishing a clear pathway to smaller nodes. Project Ahmes represents the semiconductor equivalent of the "arsenal of democracy"—distributed, resilient manufacturing that can't be eliminated by a single strike or blockade. Consuming less than 5% of an EUV fab's electricity, it avoids approximately 50 kt CO₂e/year.

*For less than the price of a single F-35 fighter, Project Ahmes delivers a permanent, distributed foundry for every radiation-hardened controller, missile seeker, and hypersonic sensor required for national security over the next decade—with no foreign dependencies or permissions required.*

## 2 Strategic Vulnerability

1. **Geopolitical choke-point** – Export controls on EUV scanners or key sub-assemblies can halt domestic production overnight.  
2. **Supply-chain fragility** – Multi-year lead times for EUV mirrors, CO₂ lasers, and photoresist chemistry tether production capacity.  
3. **Mask cost spiral** – Advanced reticle sets exceed USD 15 million per tape-out, discouraging agile design iterations.  
4. **National-security exposure** – Limited trusted-foundry throughput endangers secure electronics for critical infrastructure and defense.  
5. **Intelligence vulnerability** – Large fabs with thousands of personnel present significant counterintelligence challenges and infiltration risk.

## 3 Mask-less Lithography Research Avenues

| Track | Current Capability | Principal Limitation | Ahmes Goal |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Hydrogen-Depassivation STM** | 1–2 nm atomic precision | μm² s⁻¹ throughput | Parallelize via MEMS multi-tip arrays at 100× speed |
| **Thermal SPL – *Millipede*** | 1 K–10 K tips, 20–40 nm features | Tip heating; \<10 mm s⁻¹ write speed | Integrate h-BN heat guides to reach 100 mm s⁻¹ |
| **Focused He-Ion Beam** | \<10 nm half-pitch over mm fields | Column cost; wafer charging | Develop low-cost columns & pulsed neutralizer |
| **Nano-Imprint \+ Tip Repair** | 20–40 nm replication at wafer scale | Master creation; defect repair | Hybrid NIL \+ SPL repair for \<100 defects cm⁻² |

## 4 Enabling Innovation – Phonon-Polariton Heat Routing

UVA researchers demonstrated **ballistic phonon-polariton transport** in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), delivering \>10× Fourier-limit in-plane heat flux over 50–100 μm. Finite-element modeling shows that embedding sub-100 nm h-BN ribbons beneath SPL cantilevers:

* reduces peak tip ΔT by ≈ 5 ×,  
* enables **≥100 mm s⁻¹** write speed,  
* extends tip life to ≈10 km sliding distance.

This breakthrough directly removes the primary blocker to production-grade Millipede SPL throughput and represents the kind of asymmetric technology advantage that allows the US to outpace competitors who are locked into capital-intensive approaches.

## 5 Target Node Selection and Roadmap

### 5.1 Why 45 nm Delivers Immediate Strategic Value

| Application | Strategic Importance of 45 nm |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Radiation-hardened & space** | Wider devices and thicker oxides resist single-event upsets better than 7–14 nm CMOS. NASA, ESA, and DoD radiation-tolerant libraries currently target 45/65 nm. |
| **Autonomous systems** | Edge AI processors for contested environments require 45nm-class chips that maintain performance under radiation, temperature extremes, and power constraints. |
| **Hypersonic control systems** | Guidance electronics must withstand extreme thermal and mechanical stress—precisely where 45nm thick-oxide devices excel. |
| **Automotive & industrial MCUs** | Safety-critical controllers require 15-year reliability and \-40°C to 175°C operation; these PDKs operate at 40–55 nm because leakage and gate-oxide stress become problematic below this range. |
| **Secure/defense ASICs** | Many cryptographic accelerators and FPGA fabrics ship on 28–65 nm nodes to balance density, power, and trust-level qualification. |
| **Intelligence community hardware** | Specialized electronics for collection systems and secure communications that must operate in GPS-denied environments. |

Project Ahmes directly addresses critical capability gaps identified in the FY2025 DoD Microelectronics Strategy, providing domestic sourcing for rad-hard 45nm ASICs essential to the Missile Defense Agency's next-generation interceptor tracking systems, Space Force's satellite resilience program, and SOCOM's autonomous systems initiatives.

Moving components currently manufactured on aging 130/90 nm trusted lines to 45 nm delivers a full order-of-magnitude performance improvement immediately, without waiting for sub-10 nm manufacturing capabilities.

### 5.2 Future Scaling Roadmap

| Generation | SPL Enhancement | Node Target | Key Technological Steps |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **G-1 (pilot)** | Baseline 4,096 tips, h-BN coolers | 45 nm | Validate overlay, tip wear, NIL hybrid workflow |
| **G-2 (year 3-4)** | 8,192 tips, sharper DLC apex, UV-assist curing | 28–32 nm | Dual-pattern SPL; in-situ SEM overlay |
| **G-3 (year 5-6)** | Hydrogen-depassivation local trim \+ block-copolymer DSA pre-pattern | 14–16 nm | Mixed chemical/mechanical patterning; atomic-edge vias |

Each technology generation uses the same stages, clean-room infrastructure, and incremental MEMS improvements—keeping capital expenditure in the double-digit-million range rather than the multi-billion EUV realm. This scalable approach ensures that Project Ahmes remains relevant not just for current defense systems, but establishes the fabrication ecosystem for quantum, neuromorphic, and photonic technologies that will define the battlefield of 2035 and beyond.
